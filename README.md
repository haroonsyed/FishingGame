The first programming project I have ever done, it was made using code.org for AP Computer Science principles in late 2018.

The project earned me a 5 in the class, and was also legitimately fun for many classmates during downtime in classes.

There is nothing too special about it, other than showing my aptitude and growth within the first two to three months of seriously programming. The project is monolothic and has many design flaws, but it is what sparked my interest in programming.
